    # NUMBER OF PLAYERS =========================================================================== #
    #   Please specify how many players per market will participate.                                #
    players_per_group = 4

    # VALUATION VECTORS =========================================================================== #
    #   Different player types can have different valuation vectors for resources. Set the          #
    #   valuation vectors for each type and resource (Please keep in mind that the number of value  #
    #   vectors has to be a number that is completely divisible by the variable                     #
    #   "players_per_group"). E.g., if the market has three types and six resources, set the first  #
    #   six values within the list for a type to a number. Please stick to the scheme below.        #
    #   This app supports up to 10 types and 10 resources. Types are generated by id_in_group.      #
    #   This means that if you have 4 players and 2 types, players 1 and 2 are Type1, and           #
    #   players 3 and 4 are Type2.                                                                  #
    val3_t1 = [18, 13, 8, 3]
    val3_t2 = [8, 18, 3, 13]
    val3_t3 = [13, 18, 3, 8]
    val3_t4 = [8, 13, 3, 18]
    #   Set vectors for multiple types in the following way:
    #       val3_t2 = [85, 2, 2, 80, 50, 80, 80, 30, 80, 80]
    #       val3_t3 = [85, 2, 2, 80, 50, 80, 80, 30, 80, 80]
    #       val3_t4 = [85, 2, 2, 80, 50, 80, 80, 30, 80, 80]
    #       ...

    # prio3 OF RESOURCES OVER PARTICIPANTS =================================================== #
    #   Since this app models only the proposing side as active players, the prio3 of the      #
    #   resources over the players have to be specified. Please assign a priority vector for every  #
    #   resource. The length of each vector has to be equal to the number of players specified      #
    #   above. The structure is [<Player with Priority 1>, <Player with Priority 2>, ...]           #
    prio3_r1 = [3, 2, 4, 1]
    prio3_r2 = [4, 2, 3, 1]
    prio3_r3 = [1, 2, 4, 3]
    prio3_r4 = [2, 4, 3, 1]

    #   Set vectors for multiple resources in the following way:
    #       prio3_r2 = [1, 2]
    #       prio3_r3 = [1, 2]
    #       ...

    # RESOURCE CAPACITIES ========================================================================= #
    #   Set the quota of players that each resource can carry. Fill in as many number as in the     #
    #   valuation vectors.                                                                          #
